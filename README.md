# PEARL(Video Analyzer AI for Motion of Particles in Superfliud Helium-4)



## <u>Description:</u>

This project aims to create an analyzer AI and toolkit that when observes a "two-fluid flows of superfluid helium-4" lab video, it is capable of estimating the physical functions for the particle motions, as well as giving intermediate analyzing results. 

## Motivation:

Search project of US National Academy of Science https://www.pnas.org/content/111/Supplement_1/4653
